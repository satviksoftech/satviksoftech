  "content":"What is coding or programming? It is interesting that though many people talk about coding/programming nowadays, very few actually delve into this very fundamental question. For this question, most would answer as Solving a problem by giving instructions to a computer in a programming language. Although this is almost correct, it gives a false impression that coding is something new and was not existent before the invention of the computer. That is our next question\nIs programming or coding new? Well, the answer to this question is NO. That may come as a surprise for many reading this post. But let me justify. Programming is just problem solving. And to solve a problem we need a language. Mathematics, is also a language. There are some universally accepted symbols, like +,- etc. for various kinds of operations using which we describe solution to problems. This fact that Computer Science is just another offshoot of mathematics is carefully hidden from students especially in India, maybe to get more students admitted in colleges. This has also led to many believing that one does not need to be a good mathematician to become a good software developer.\nMathematics as a language Mathematics is something we are taught right from our childhood and many have dreaded memories of the same. I would say plain old mathematics combined with problem solving is enough to become good at anything in life, including coding. However, there are some drawbacks with pure mathematical approach:\nSolution given using mathematics is not easily self verifiable, atleast not a easy as writing test cases and verfiying. Solutions tend to be largely \u0026ldquo;imaginary\u0026rdquo;, in the sense that no tangible outcome can be seen. Mathematics is fully generic. It means we can use mathematical formulae to describe anything. However, this itself means the number of symbols is HUGE and overwhelming. Enough to take students away from mathematics. Even though the listed drawbacks are strong, we should understand that mathematical temperament is essential to become a good computer scientist. As a result, all computer science students are still required to take Discrete Mathematics subject in their degree.\nC Programming Language C Programming language has been one the oldest programming languages, thus it has been traditionally offered as the first language for learning programming in almost all colleges and training institutes. It introduces procedural programming paradigm to solve problems which has its own advantages. However, I do not consider it to be a good language to learn for a beginner. Here are the reasons for it:\nC language encourages imperative style of coding, where we have to tell the computer everything that needs to be done. This leads to unintuitive and complex code. A person trying to understand problem should focus more on solving the problem than on focusing on the internals of computers. Coding in C requires a person to focus equally (many times more) on computer internals and programming. Building projects in C requires sound knowledge of concepts like pointers, which are quite complex to comprehend for a beginner. From usage perspective too, a person is more likely to use any other language like Java, Python etc. in their projects over C. Although C as a beginner language has these shortcomings, it is a must for any computer science student as one learns about computers a lot more if they learn C properly. C programming plus Linux is always a deadly combination. Which is the best beginner programming language? I have always been a big promoter of Python as a beginner programming language. There are lots of reasons for thinking like this. Here are a few:\nPython is quite humane. In the sense that code in python is almost like talking in english(if written properly). Here is a sample program in python to add numbers in a string written in C and python. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;ctype.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; int addNumbers(const char* word){ char *letter = word; int sum = 0; while (*letter){ if(isdigit(*letter)) sum += atoi(*letter); letter++; } return sum; } int main(){ printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;,addNumbers(\u0026#34;h12nd6mn4\u0026#34;)); } The above program is written in C. You may compare it with implementation in python given below\n1 2 3 4 def addNumbers(word): return sum([int(letter) for letter in word if letter.isdigit()]) print(addNumbers(\u0026#34;h12nd6mn4\u0026#34;)) Python encourages the student to focus more on programming ie. solving the given problem rather than getting engrossed in internal language and computer details like memory consumption, address etc. Python has many built in data structures which are easy to use and students can learn usage of these data structures without ever implementing any on their own. Python can be used to build almost any application except system software Python does not enforce any one particular programming paradigm. Java for eg. forces Object Oriented Programming. Python does encourage OOP but does not enforce it. Python forces many good programming practices. Eg. Code Identation Conclusion Every language is beautiful in its own sense. However, we always prefer as beginner programming language. Python can be easily learnt without learning any other language. Go give it a try!\n"},{

  "content":"What is the purpose of education? The purpose of education to make kids knowledgeable with facts, equip them to rationally think and apply the facts to solve real world problems. An educated individual should be hard to manipulate by various cunning means like bribe. An educated individual should have basic knowledge of what is good and what is not. An educated individual should be a better human being.\nEducation - From the eyes of indian parents, teachers and society Indians nowadys are fed right from their childhood that they need to go to school so that they become \u0026ldquo;employable\u0026rdquo;. To become employable one must get good marks in exams (through fair or unfair means). For eg. a 12th standard or PU student will want to take up Computer Science Engineering not to study the subject but to get placed in some \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; company and draw a fat salary. Crores of young men take special coaching classes to clear exams like JEE, NEET, GATE etc. They even waste 3-5 years of their precious lives just to clear these exams. Only because of the attraction towards a \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; job.\nAs far as parents are concerned, they want their wards to become famous, atleast in their local circles. Eg. Many parents enroll their children to singing classes so that their wards will come on some reality show and become \u0026ldquo;successfull\u0026rdquo;. Parents imbibe this mindset that success = more money, success = becoming famous.\nTeachers on the other hand make this mindset even stronger by encouraging students to write answers \u0026ldquo;as they have taught\u0026rdquo;. They too inculcate this mindset that \u0026ldquo;more marks = success\u0026rdquo;. Most teachers are themselves weak in the subjects they teach. Teachers cant be fully blamed for this though. Most people take up teaching as a profession as a last resort and not out of passion.\nThe devastating role of government and managements The government keeps taking reports from various universities about the number of graduates, PHD\u0026rsquo;s etc. These universities in turn tighten the screws on affiliated colleges to \u0026ldquo;show\u0026rdquo; improved results and high pass percentages. The colleges and schools(most of which are run by politicians) are simply interested in money minting by increasing intake of students. With about 60+ students stuffed in a class, and mediocre teachers obviously the quality of education will go down. But, the college/school cannot show bad results. Thus, we have reached a point where teachers themselves are encouraging students to do malpractise. This \u0026ldquo;Outcome based education\u0026rdquo; has led to schools and colleges being top-class \u0026ldquo;on paper\u0026rdquo;.\nThe school/college managements are also simply concerned about money. They pay teachers very less, expect them to be more like clerks, maintaining all sorts of useless documents as proof that students are indeed learning. So teachers, to save their jobs, are left with no other option but to become good teachers on paper.\nWhat is the current state of students in India? Currently, students in India are on paper educated. Many degree students are not even capable of reading books, writing letters even in their own mother tongue. In fact, mastering mother tongue is considered inferior than mastering english. Taking commission/bribe has become a norm and there is no way to stop this. Since most people spend lakhs of money on \u0026ldquo;getting educated\u0026rdquo;, they need to earn much more later on by any means, even if means killing someone else. Moral education is simply not present.\nWhat is the solution? The solution to this is seperating money from education. The traditional education system in India was not at all about job and money. In fact it considered a crime to take money and teach in India. There are still many gurukuls in India following this same pattern. If companies start recruiting people based on skills and not degrees or certificates and government encourages the same, this mafia can be easily brought down. For eg. if a company need a person who can build software why should that person have 70% aggregate? If a person wants to become a driver, why should he have a 10th standard certificate? Parents too need to think if they want their children to be boot licking employees or free individuals who can face any eventuality with courage. We need to act on this fast. It is already very late!!\n"},{

  "content":"What is Flask? Flask is a very popular \u0026ldquo;micro\u0026rdquo; web development framework built with Python. The framework is most popular especially for small to medium size applications. For me, this framework has been THE framework of choice for most of my python projects.\nFlask is the framework for beginners, especially if you do not have solid understanding of how the web works. I personally started with Django, but got stuck as it does many things behind the scenes and one must use ORM almost compulsorily to use django. Flask on the other hand is quite simplistic and the purpose of this article is to show you how to use it to build a simple CRUD app with sqlite database.\nWhat are we building? We are build a simple application to add and display car information. The whole code is available in github link\nSpinning up a basic app Here is the code to build a simple hello world flask app\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ######################## # Simple hello world app ######################## from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) def index(): return \u0026#34;hello world\u0026#34; app.run(debug=True) The line app = Flask(__name__) creates a Flask class instance which is used throughout the code. Url routing is defined through the @app decorative in line 3. The line says that whenever a http GET request is made to the / url call the function index. The last line starts the app in debug mode so that the app auto restarts whenver we make changes and save.\nNow, if you open a browser and type localhost:5000 and hit enter key you will see a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; on the screen.\nCreating tables We create another file database.py to house the entire database related code. Here is the code to create the tables company and car. Each car belongs to a company, thus, there is a foreign key relationship\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 import sqlite3 import datetime def getConnection(): conn = sqlite3.connect(\u0026#34;car.db\u0026#34;) conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row return conn def create(): conn = getConnection() try: query = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; create table company(id integer primary key autoincrement, name varchar(30) not null, address text, phone varchar(10)) \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; conn.execute(query) conn.commit() query = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; create table car(id integer primary key autoincrement, name varchar(30) not null, model varchar(30) not null, color varchar(10) default \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, launch_date date default CURRENT_DATE, company integer not null, foreign key (company) references company(id)) \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; conn.execute(query) conn.commit() except Exception as e: print(e) finally: conn.close() We take a connection and execute the sql query for creating tables. The database used here is sqlite3 which comes preinstalled with python 3+.\nThe code for other functions is self explainatory. The main task everytime is\nTake database connection\nExecute query\nReturn result / status\nRendering html Flask requires a folder called templates. You can create html files and store in this folder. Jinja template engine is used by flask to generate dynamic pages on the server side. Here is an example.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;X-UA-Compatible\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;IE=edge\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Main Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {% for i in range(10) %} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello {{name}}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {% endfor %} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; We need to set up a url to render this page. We need to use render_template function to render the page\n1 2 3 4 5 @app.route(\u0026#34;/search\u0026#34;) def index(): name = request.args.get(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;world\u0026#34;) # return f\u0026#34;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello {name}!!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026#34; return render_template(\u0026#34;index.html\u0026#34;, name=name) Now, if you open the url localhost:5000/search?name=ram you will get Hello ram 10 times. You can download and playaround with the code. To add static files (css,js etc) just add another folder called static and use in the html files.\n"},{

  "content":"I came across this problem while building an app recently and thought it might be interesting to share. The problem we are trying to solve is of displaying numbers according to locale. Eg. in india, number 100000 is written as 1,00,000 while in US it is written as 100,000. So, how can we write a program to format numbers properly according to the locale in Javascript and Python is the question we are trying to answer.\nBrute force way!! The raw or brute force way for doing this is to write a program from scratch. However, to be able to handle different locales we will have to come up with a pretty non-trivial program. Since I was concentrating on Indian locale (100000 as 1,00,000 etc.), I came up with a simple program for doing the same in Javascript.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 function format(number){ let formattedNumber = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; let i=0; if(number.length%2==0){ formattedNumber += number[i++]+\u0026#34;,\u0026#34; } //place ,(comma) every two digits for(; i\u0026lt;number.length-3; i+=2){ formattedNumber += number[i]+number[i+1]+\u0026#34;,\u0026#34; } //join in remaining digits while(i\u0026lt;number.length){ formattedNumber += number[i++] } return formattedNumber } let givenNumber = \u0026#39;100000\u0026#39; //read the number as a string //if number has less than 4 digits display as it is console.log((givenNumber.length \u0026lt; 4)?givenNumber:format(givenNumber)) The logic here is pretty straightforward. If the number of digits is even then we append the first digit followed by a comma and append comma every third digit. Else, we just append comma every third digit. Of course, there are lots of other ways to do the same. However, the preferred way is to just use the builtin internationalization module (Intl) in JS.\n1 2 let number = 100000 console.log(new Intl.NumberFormat(\u0026#39;en-IN\u0026#39;).format(number)); //1,00,000 We can customize the output even more by passing in options argument and also locales. Since I was mainly interested in Indian locale I ve used \u0026ldquo;en-IN\u0026rdquo;. For more information please read Intl MDN docs Python too has a module called locale.\n1 2 3 4 import locale locale.setlocale(locale.LC_NUMERIC, \u0026#34;en_IN\u0026#34;) number = 100000 print(f\u0026#34;{number:n}\u0026#34;) As you can see both python and javascript have quite good support for internationalization.\n"},{
