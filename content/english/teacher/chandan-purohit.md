### About Me

Computer Science has emerged as the truly evergreen discipline in engineering. However, with this the number of students pursuing Computer Science Engineering related courses has also increased. As demand grows, quality goes down. The same has happened to the quality of education in India. Most colleges are churning out unskilled graduates each year and the numbers are only going to increase.

I had a passion towards teaching right from my school days. I had also witnessed that the quality of teachers had been dwindling a rapid pace each year. So I always wanted to be a teacher who would impart practical knowledge rather than encourage rote learning. Thus,  after completing my engineering in [R.V. College of Engineering, Bengaluru](https://www.rvce.edu.in/) from the dept. of Information Science, I decided to work at a software company, [Sasken Communication](https://www.sasken.com/), where I worked as a Software Engineer for 1 year. To realize my dream of becoming a teacher, I understood that getting a masters degree would be essential. Thus, I left my job at Sasken and joined MTech course in [KLE Technological University(formerly BVB College of Engg), Hubballi](https://www.kletech.ac.in/). After completion of my Masters in Computer Science, I worked as Assistant Professor at [KLEIT, Hubballi](https://www.kleit.ac.in/) for 4 years in Dept. of Information Science. All these years I had constantly kept updating my programming skills. This was when I realized that students want jobs but have lost interest in studies. Thus, I decided to quit my lucrative job in KLEIT and started my own company to train and place students in Software domain. 

The motto I have is simple. Study for the joy of knowledge and you will get everything you want in life. WE DO NOT PLACE STUDENTS in Sathvik Softech. But we have 100% placement record consistently for the past 6 years. Our mantra is simple. If you gain knowledge companies will hire you. We also have our own software development division in IT park hubballi, [Samarth Meditech](http://www.samarthmeditech.com/) where we hire good students who get trained by us. My firm belief is that learning programming is just like learning to swim. One cannot learn swimming without being in water. Just like that, one cannot learn programming without actually coding in a computer. Thus, right from the day of inception of Sathvik Softech, we have been successfully following a unique hands-on, live-coding based approach to teaching programming to students and will continue to do the same.
