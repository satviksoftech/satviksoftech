### About Event
At Sathvik Softech we had organized 1 month internship programme on Python for Machine Learning for final year VTU students in collaboration with [Samarth Meditech Pvt. Ltd.](http://samarthmeditech.com), a company housed in IT Park, Hubli. A total of 3 batches were conducted and the students underwent rigourous training in software development tools and techniques which are helpful for machine learning.

The training sessions were completely hands-on coding sessions with emphasis on improving logical thinking and also gaining strong foundations in the vast and diverse field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The students worked on many projects throughout the course such as building AI-driven games, text analysis like predicting sentiment from text, image analysis using opencv, skimage and sklearn.
