## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Sathvik Softech was started in the year 2015 with the intention of boosting software industry in Hubballi through rigourous training and live project develpment experience. Now, 5+ years have passed and we have been the backbone of many startups in North Karnataka region and also boast of near 100% organic placement record. Our students( many of whom have also been our employees ) are working in top companies and delivering very good work in their companies. 

We were the first ones to provide teaching of courses machine learning with python, deep learning, artificial intelligence, modern web development etc. We are also proud that students without degrees too have been successfully placed organically ie. without any illegal or commission based recruitment. Our motto for teaching is simple. <b>Live coding sessions with problem solving</b>. We make sure every student codes(literally) in every class of any course he/she takes. We also hire students and make them work on our client projects which makes them gain vast experience. For us degrees do not matter. We believe degrees do more harm than good as far as learning and becoming successful is concerned. Thus, the only criteria for anyone to join us is dedication towards learning. 

We continue to strive hard to update our course content and keep it up to date with the ever changing software development landscape. Our internship programmes too contribute immensely towards achieving this goal. Our in house training has been very successful in giving us talented students who are dedicated and hard working. Hope to see you soon!
