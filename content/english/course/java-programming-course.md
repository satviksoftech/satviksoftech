about: "This is a unique Java course which takes student from novice to professional android developer all within a single month. Our unique hands-on approach coupled with focus on OOP strategies to solve problems lays down strong foundation for advanced Java concepts.

This is must have course for any student wishing to truly understand OOP concepts. Java is a very popular language in which Object Oriented Programming is heavily relied upon. We focus on unique aspects of Java right from first class so that students are able to think the Java way right from the beginning. The course also focuses on reading official documentation so that students also learn how to learn on their own. The course ends with Android App Development using Java"
